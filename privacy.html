                            <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
                            <p>The MINDNERVES.CA Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed
                            on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses
                            to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server
                            in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide
                            a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that
                            you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize MINDNERVES.CA pages, or register
                            with MINDNERVES.CA site or services, a cookie helps MINDNERVES.CA to recall your specific information on
                            subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
                            billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same MINDNERVES.CA Web site,
                            the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the MINDNERVES.CA features
                            that you customized. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
                            accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
                            If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features
                            of the MINDNERVES.CA services or Web sites you visit.</p>
